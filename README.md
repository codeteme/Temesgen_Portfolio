# [Project 2: Gebeta](https://github.com/codeteme/Gebeta)

Gebeta is one of the oldest board games in the world. The project will allow two users to play against each other in a single account. The project will allow a user to play against the computer. The project might also allow the users to play in multiplayer mode.

Algorithmic Plan: I will employ alpha-beta pruning to allow a user to play against the computer. The static evaluation on the final positions would look at the number of marbles in the big bucket. In other words, the greater the number of marbles, the better the move is for the chosen player. If the number of marbles in the opposition's big bucket is larger than the chosen player's, then the static evaluation will yield a negative result (marbles in the big bucket of chosen player - marbles in big bucket of opposition player)
