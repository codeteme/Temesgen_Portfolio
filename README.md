# [Project 1: LinkedIn Web Scraper](https://github.com/codeteme/LinkedInDemoResearch)

Using LinkedIn Campaign Manager audience count data to pursue social science research.

Users can specify the attributes for the following variables:

    Interface locale (required)
    Location (required)
    Gender
    Age range
    Job seniority

Users can also append multiple boolean arguments. The following three are supported.

    OR
    AND
    NOT

# [Project 2: Gebeta](https://github.com/codeteme/Gebeta)

Gebeta is one of the oldest board games in the world. The project will allow two users to play against each other in a single account. The project will allow a user to play against the computer. The project might also allow the users to play in multiplayer mode.

Algorithmic Plan: I will employ alpha-beta pruning to allow a user to play against the computer. The static evaluation on the final positions would look at the number of marbles in the big bucket. In other words, the greater the number of marbles, the better the move is for the chosen player. If the number of marbles in the opposition's big bucket is larger than the chosen player's, then the static evaluation will yield a negative result (marbles in the big bucket of chosen player - marbles in big bucket of opposition player)

## [Project 3: Book Sale Prediction](https://github.com/codeteme/goodreads_sales_prediction)

Machine Learning has been used widely to make predictions of consumer products, especially music and movies. However, it has not been widely used to make book related predictions, even though books are widely sold consumer products. In this notebook, we make use of machine learning to predict book sales using several book attributes. We believe this model can be useful for many including publishers, authors, and book shops.

In our literature review, we came across two papers that examined other aspects of the whole book ecosystem i.e. users and reviewers. Both papers made use of Goodreads, the most popular book review platform. We also chose the website because of the sheer number of books it tracks and are discussed. Getting the data, however, was a very challenging task and might also explain lack of interest in building book related models. Goodreads officially retired its API service two years ago, so we had to resort to scraping the page in a very inconvenient way. Fortunately, we succeeded.

Book sale records are not publicly available. There are companies that have the data but they sell it at very high prices. In this project, we want to develop proxy items that can indicate the true book sale record of books in the English language so further researchers can use these proxies. Additionally, we would touch on almost every topic covered in the course, including web scraping, data cleaning, data visualization, data analysis, data modeling, NLP and so on.

## [Project 4: Vaccine Hesitancy](https://github.com/codeteme/130422-V2)


Religious Correlates in Covid-19 Vaccine Hesitancy: Does religion influence vaccine uptake of the US population? 


Quantitative and qualitative exploration is required to better comprehend the demographics of groups with the most hesitant individuals and utilize different approaches that cater to these groups with different ideologies. This study explores essential factors that determine individualsâ€™ behaviors towards COVID-19 vaccines. Particularly, we evaluate the difference in vaccination uptake among followers of a religion and non-followers. Additionally, we examine the variance among three popular religious groups - Islam, Christianity, and Judaism - in the US.  Identification of the salient factors would be an important insight health communicators and policymakers can use to develop public health communication campaigns and pass vaccine mandate policies, respectively.

## [Project 5: Google Scholar Scraper](https://github.com/codeteme/google_scholar_scraper)

This project is intended for academics planning to collect all relevant search engine result pages. Users can use the simple webpage to put in parameters such as keywords (both optional and must-contain), year range to search, and language. The python script would then iteratively run these queries and collect the returned articles features such as title, auhor name, publicatio, info, year published.
